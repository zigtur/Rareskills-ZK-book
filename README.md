## Summary
### Monoid
- A magma is a set with a closed binary operator.
- A semigroup is a magma where the binary operator must be associative.
- A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.

### Group
It is a set with:
* an associative and closed binary operator
* an identity element
* every element has an inverse
* (abelian group:) 
    * binary operator is commutative

Order of a group = the number of elements in it

Cyclic group = group that has a generator element, allows to generate every other elements with the binary operator

Product of groups exist and are useful.

### Ring
It is a set with two binary operators such that:
- under first binary operator, the set is an abelian group
- under second binary operator, the set is a monoid
    - Monoid: only the inverse property is missing to make it a group
    - if monoid is commutative, then it is an **abelian ring**
- second binary distributes over the first


### Field
It is a set with two bin operators such that:
- under the first, the set is an abelian group
- under the second (excluding the zero element), the set is an abelian group
